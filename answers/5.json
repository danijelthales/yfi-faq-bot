      "value": "$YFI (wai-fu) is the token for Yearn Finance with a total supply of 30,000. \n\nYearn described $YFI as follows:\n\"In further efforts to give up this control (mostly because we are lazy and don’t want to do it), we have released YFI, a completely valueless 0 supply token. We reiterate, it has 0 financial value. There is no pre-mine, there is no sale, no you cannot buy it, no, it won’t be on uniswap, no, there won’t be an auction. We don’t have any of it.\"\n\nYFI token has three core functions:\n- Governance: You get to vote on proposals or YIPs that shape how the yearn ecosystem evolves\n- Cryptocurrency: YFI is a liquid asset that can be transacted on the Ethereum network\n- Interest bearing: When you stake your YFI in the governance platform you earn a % of the fees generated by the different yearn products."
