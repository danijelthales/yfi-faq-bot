      "value": "Test in prod refers to testing in production. It's a phrase Andre Cronje (creator of YFI) uses as a disclaimer for the products he builds.\nIt means Andre is shipping new products, like Vaults, before they go through exhaustive testing and security audits. This is why there is a disclaimer on every yearn product.\nThe concept of \"test in prod\" was also been embraced by the community, even seeing it on hoodies or tweets."
